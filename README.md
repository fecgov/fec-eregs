Glue project which combines regulations-site, regulations-core and
styles/templates specific to FEC. Packaged as a cloud.gov app.

## Local Development
Like regulations-site and regulations-core, this application requires Python 2.7.

Use pip and npm to download the required libraries:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
$ npm install
$ npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

Then initialize the database, build the front-end, and run the server:

```bash
$ npm run build
$ python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
$ python manage.py compile_frontend
$ python manage.py runserver
```

### Data

If you are also working on the parser, it'd be a good idea to test your
changes locally:

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver &    # start the server as a background process
$ cd path/to/regulations-parser
$ eregs pipeline 11 4 http://localhost:8000/api   # send the data
```

If you aren't working on the parser, you may want to just configure the
application to run against the live API:

```bash
$ echo "API_BASE = 'https://fec-prod-eregs.app.cloud.gov/regulations/api/'" >> local_settings.py
```

### Ports

For the time being, this application, which cobbles together
[regulations-core](https://github.com/18F/regulations-core) and
[regulations-site](https://github.com/18F/regulations-site), makes HTTP calls
to itself. The server therefore needs to know which port it is set up to
listen on.

We default to 8000, as that's the standard for django's `runserver`, but if
you need to run on a different port, either export an environmental variable
or create a local_settings.py as follows:

```bash
$ export PORT=1234
```

OR

```bash
$ echo "API_BASE = 'http://localhost:1234/api/'" >> local_settings.py
```

## Architecture

![General Architecture (described below)](docs/architecture.png)

This repository is a cloud.gov app which stitches together two large Django
libraries with cloud.gov datastores and some FEC-specific styles and
templates. The first library, `regulations-core`, defines an API for reading
and writing regulation and associated data. `fec-eregs` mounts this
application at the `/api` endpoint (details about the "write" API will be
discussed later). The second library, `regulations-site`, defines the UI. When
rendering templates, `regulations-site` will first look in `fec-eregs` to see
if the templates have been overridden. These views pull their data from the
API; this means that `fec-eregs` makes HTTP calls to itself to retrieve data
(when it's not already cached).

## Updating Data

![Deploying New Data Schematic (described below)](docs/updating-data.png)

When there is new data available (e.g. due to modifications in the parser, new
Federal Register notices, etc.), that data must be sent to the `/api` endpoint
before it will be visible to users. However, we don't want to allow the
general public to modify the regulatory data, so we need to authenticate.
Currently, this is implemented via HTTP Basic Auth and a very long user name
and password (effectively creating an API key). See the `HTTP_AUTH_USER` and
`HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD` environment variables in cloud.gov for more.

Currently, sending data looks something like this (from `regulations-parser`)

```bash
$ eregs pipeline 27 646 https://{HTTP_AUTH_USER}:{HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD}@{LIVE_OR_DEMO_HOSTNAME}/api
```

This updates the data, but does not update the search index and will not clear
various caches. It's generally best to `cf restage` the application at this
point, which clears the caches and rebuilds the search index. Note that this
will also pull down the latest versions of the libraries (see the next
section); as a result it's generally best to do a full deploy after updating
data.

## Deploying Code

If the code within `fec-eregs`, `regulations-core`, or `regulations-site` has
been updated, you will want to deploy the updated code to cloud.gov.


### Environments

We're currently deploying to multiple environments, a `dev`, `stage`, and a `prod`
instance. All environments are deployed automatically based on [git
flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/).

Environment | URL                              | Proxy | Description
----------- | ---                              | ----- | -----------
`dev`       | https://fec-dev-eregs.app.cloud.gov/   | https://fec-dev-proxy.app.cloud.gov/regulations/ | Ad-hoc testing, deploys the latest changes from `develop`.
`stage`     | https://fec-stage-eregs.app.cloud.gov/ | https://fec-stage-proxy.app.cloud.gov/regulations/ | Staging site, deployed from branches matching `release/*`.
`prod`      | https://fec-prod-eregs.app.cloud.gov/  | https://www.fec.gov/regulations/ | Production site, deployed from any tagged commit.


### Travis

These are the basic steps of what get runs on travis. To be sure, check the
[.travis.yml](https://github.com/18F/fec-eregs/blob/develop/.travis.yml) file.

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt   # updates the -core/-site repositories
$ npm run build # builds the fec-style css
$ python manage.py compile_frontend   # builds the frontend
$ cf target -s ${cf_space} && cf zero-downtime-deploy eregs -f manifest.${cf_space}.yml
```
