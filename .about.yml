description:
  Campaign finance laws are complex.  The Federal Election Commission (FEC) provides a plethora of legal resources that aides the public in navigating those laws.  The content is vast and highly valuable. However, navigating those resources on FEC.gov is extremely difficult;
  to the point that it often takes highly trained (and therefor expensive) individuals and tools to adequately locate the correct resources and answer the question on hand.
  The FEC Legal Resources project is tasked with redesigning how the public finds, navigates and views those resources.
